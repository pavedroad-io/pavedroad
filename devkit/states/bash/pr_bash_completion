# Setting up bash completion
#
# Completion functionality requires that bash be version 4 or later.
# The pavedroad devkit installs the bash-completion package
#   and installs additional individual completion files
#   in /usr/local/share/bash/completions/pavedroad.
#
# For macOS see:
#   https://docs.brew.sh/Shell-Completion
# macOS does not allow installs over commands in /bin and /usr/bin.
# The homebrew package manager installs in /usr/local/bin by default.
# In order to chsh to a later version of bash in /usr/local/bin
#   the line "/usr/local/bin/bash" must be added to /etc/shells.
# Homebrew installs the bash-completion@2 package in /usr/local/share with
#   the completion files in /usr/local/share/bash-completion/completions.
# Homebrew installs additional individual completion files
#   in /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d.
#
# For linux see:
#   https://github.com/scop/bash-completion
# Package managers install the bash-completion package in /usr/share with
#   the completion files in /usr/share/bash-completion/completions.
