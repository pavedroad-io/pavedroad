# Development Kit Docker Containers

This directory contains a Dockerfile for each of the platforms that the 
Unix bootstrap script has been tested to build a docker container.
For each Dockerfile a shell script is provided that runs
the docker build command.
The scripts also give examples of how options are passed to the
Unix bootstrap script.

### Platforms Tested

For detailed information on platforms that have been tested see:
[Platforms Tested](https://github.com/pavedroad-io/pavedroad/blob/master/devkit/PLATFORMS.md).
