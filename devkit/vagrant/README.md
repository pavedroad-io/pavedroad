# Development Kit Vagrant VirtualBox VMs

This directory contains a subdirectory for each of the platforms that the 
Unix bootstrap script has been tested in a Vagrant VirtualBox VM.
Each subdirectory contains a Vagrantfile for each of the platforms that the 
Unix bootstrap script has been tested in a VirtualBox VM.
In addition to the Vagrantfile in each subdirectory a shell script
is provided that runs the "vagrant up" command.
These scripts also provide examples of how options are passed to the
Unix bootstrap script.
