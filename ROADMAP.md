# PavedRoad Roadmap

This document defines a high level roadmap for PavedRoad development
and upcoming releases.
Community and contributor involvement is vital for successfully implementing
all desired items for each release.
We hope that the items listed below will inspire further engagement from the community
to keep PavedRoad progressing and shipping exciting and valuable features.

Any dates listed below and the specific issues that will ship in a given milestone
are subject to change but should give a general idea of what we are planning.
We use the [Roadmap Milestones](https://github.com/pavedroad-io/kevlar-repo/milestones)
